# gRPC-Example
Following is a practise project for gRPC and Protocol Buffers in dart language.

If you are pulling this repository, make sure you need a proto compiler installed in your sysrtem.
In this practise project, a seerver on local host with local port is coded and then data is fetched in binary systems using gRPC architechture. 
gRPC is and alternative to REST APIS and is much faster and easier to trasmit or fetch data by making calls.
